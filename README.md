# Spark Music Player is a project I've had in mind.

# Long term, the aim is to make it a full streaming website with an Android OS app.

# But for now, it's just a plain music player built with HTML, CSS & Vanilla JS and running on my local machine.

# As my expertise increases, I'll add more features until it becomes what I envisioned it to be from the start.

# I'll update this file as I go.

# Timeline is a year from first commit to completion.
# I know it sounds a bit unrealistic, but that are the only kind of deadline my procrastinating ass can understand😁😁.

# Let's do this!
